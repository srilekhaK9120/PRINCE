### **Term Paper**

#### <code>Prince_Cipher_Term_Paper.pdf</code> file contains the term paper.

> In this paper, we have given a detailed description of PRINCE Cipher. We have drawn the motivation after the PRINCE Cipher and also given the detailed
> implementation of PRINCE Cipher. We have also digged into some of the theoretical
> and practical attacks which can be implemented on PRINCE. This cipher is created
> in a way that the overhead for decryption on the top of encryption is minute and
> negligible. Indeed, it holds that decryption for one key parallels to encryption with a related key. This property, we refer to as Î±-reflection is of independent interest and we demonstrate its robustness against generic attacks.

### **Presentation Slides and Video**

#### <code>Prince_Cipher_Presentation.pdf</code> contains the presentation sldes for project.

- This presentation slides are prepared in latex with the provided template.

#### <code>Presentation Video</code> (@ https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xd8xJ63dANLc0uJR6roOMia2ghcW6Cxb/view?usp=sharing) contains the video of our presenetation.

### **SBox Analysis**

#### <code>sbox_analysis.ipynb</code> contains the code for prince cipher implementation.

- This file contains the code for sbox analysis both using inbuilt sage functions and in pure python.

### **Software Implementation**

#### <code>software_implementation.ipynb</code> contains the code for prince cipher implementation.

- This file contains the code for encryption and decription using prince cipher.
  -There are two main functions: <code>prince_encrypter</code> and <code>prince_decrypter</code>
- Both functions take an input of 64bit (hexadecial string of length 16) message string along with 128bit (hexadecial string of length 32) key string.

### **Cryptanalysis**

<code>integral_cryptanalysis.ipynb</code> file contains the code for integral attack cryptanalysis.
